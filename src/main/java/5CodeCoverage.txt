Measuring code coverage using Emma
Improve our test coverage


Test coverage or code coverage is the number of lines of our source code that is tested 
	when our unit test runs against the source code.
	This included following:
		Conditional Statements
		Loop Statements
		No of parameters passed in the method
		Type of parameters passed in the methods
		etc.
		
		
We measure code coverage using tools. 
These tools run our tests against to the source code & gives us the percentage of code coverage.
And also show us which lines of source code are tested & which lines are not tested & which needs more testing.
