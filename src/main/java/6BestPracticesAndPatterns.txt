FIRST principle
	It is very popular in Agile Software testing world.
	F-Fast test
	I-Independent test
		One test should not be depend on other test
	R-Repeatable test
		Prod, qa, dev
	S-Self-validating test
		Boolean result, either pass or fail
	T-Timely test
		We should wrtie test on or before writing code
		
Test Doubles
	Test Doubles are common design patterns that are used across unit testing framework.

Gerard Meszaros

Analogy: Stunt doubles in movies

5 famous Test Doubles patterns:
	Dummy
		any
		Mockito.when(dao.create(Matchers.any(Order.class))).thenReturn(new Integer(1));
	Stubs
		when, thenReturn
		Mockito.when(dao.create(Matchers.any(Order.class))).thenReturn(new Integer(1));		
	Mocks
		throw exception & can verify other method has been called
	Fake
		Some shortcuts like in-memory database etc. ie. rarely used
	Spies
		They are stubs that can spy or record any side effect when we are testing a particular testing method.
		
		
Partial mocking using Mockito Spy
	ListTest.java

Spy vs Mock
It is recommended to use Mock instead of Spy.
